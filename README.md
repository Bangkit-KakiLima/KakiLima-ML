## Description
The Machine Learning model can be used to provide information about a Content-Based Filtering focuses on recommending items based on the characteristics or features of the food itself, rather than the behavior of other users. The idea is to find foods that are similar to the ones the user has previously interacted with or rated highly and Collaborative Filtering recommends food items based on the preferences of similar users. The system assumes that if users agree on one item, they are likely to agree on others. Collaborative filtering can either be user-based or item-based, but for simplicity, most systems use item-based collaborative filtering.
